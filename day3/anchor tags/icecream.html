<center> <h1> Strawberry Icecream</h1></center>
<p>Ice cream is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_dessert">frozen dessert</a> typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetene">sweetener</a>, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_coloring">Food colouring</a> is sometimes added in addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabiliser_(food)">stabilizers</a>. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystal"> ice crystals</a> from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility">malleable</a>s as its temperature increases.

ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cold dishes—like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_float">ice cream floats</a>, sundaes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake">milkshakes</a>, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_Alaska">Baked Alaska</a>.
